Perfect! Since you want to **document the entire Jumuia project** from start to finish, I’ll create **beginner-friendly, clear, structured documentation** covering:

* Project overview
* Goals & use cases
* System layers
* Users & roles
* Database design
* MVP features per layer
* Technical stack & folder structure
* Development roadmap

This will serve as your **master reference** before coding anything.

# 📝 Jumuia – Full Project Documentation

## 1️⃣ Project Overview

**Project Name:** Jumuia
**Meaning:** “Community” (Swahili)
**Primary Users:** VSLA Leaders & NGO / Relief Officers

**Mission:**

> Jumuia is a digital platform for village savings and loan associations that combines core financial management with agricultural risk tracking and disaster / relief awareness.
> It enables communities to track savings, loans, and repayments, while allowing NGOs to monitor financial vulnerability and provide timely support.

---

## 2️⃣ Project Goals

1. **Core VSLA functionality**

   * Replace paper ledgers with a digital record
   * Manage savings, loans, and repayments
   * Enable transparency and accountability

2. **Agricultural Risk Management**

   * Track farming-related loans by crop and season
   * Identify members at risk due to failed harvests
   * Provide leaders with actionable insights

3. **Disaster / Relief Layer**

   * Flag members affected by shocks (floods, droughts, fire, etc.)
   * Pause or reschedule loans during emergencies
   * Provide NGOs with read-only access for targeted support

---

## 3️⃣ Core System Layers

```text id="3kz2xp"
Layer 1: Core VSLA (always active)
Layer 2: Agriculture (focus on farming loans and risk)
Layer 3: Relief/Disaster (optional, activated when shocks occur)
```

* Each layer **builds on the previous**, allowing incremental development.
* Agriculture layer comes first for initial use-case focus.

## 10️⃣ Funding & Pitch Notes

**Pitch for funders:**

> “Village savings groups are critical for rural communities. Jumuia digitizes VSLA operations and adds agricultural risk and disaster tracking. It helps leaders manage seasonal loans and allows NGOs to monitor financial vulnerability, enabling faster recovery after shocks.”

* Agriculture = climate risk + loan exposure
* Relief = disaster preparedness + targeted assistance
* Core VSLA = transparency + trust

This makes it **fundable, real-world, and scalable**.
